\section{Introduction}

Mathematics is about things, and how they do stuff. What is a thing, what can they do, and what it means \textit{to do} is the subject of this class. We will start with discovering the underlying language of mathematics, the one that will allows us to discuss with it. It is called \cemph{logic}. It will be needed to understand what is a mathematical thing, and how they do stuff. Once this will be done, we will move on to the basics building blocs of mathematics, the one that are everywhere and that are useful to construct all sorts of other things that will do all sort of amazing constructions. Those are sets and functions. A function is the most general instance of a mathematical thing, even worse, math is in fact the study of functions. 

\begin{cdef}{}{function_basic}
    A function is a thing that do stuff.
\end{cdef}

That is it, that is math. We could stop here, but so far, it would not be very useful to do anything. Rather, what we will do is specify finer and finer behavior to our functions, and to the thing they produce so that we can say meaningful stuff about it.
