	abstract = {We revisit Kapranov and Voevodsky's idea of spaces modelled on combinatorial pasting diagrams, now as a framework for higher-dimensional rewriting and the basis of a model of weak omega-categories. In the first part, we elaborate on Steiner's theory of directed complexes as a combinatorial foundation. We individuate convenient classes of directed complexes and develop the theory of diagrammatic sets relative to one such class. We study a notion of equivalence internal to a diagrammatic set, and single out as models of weak omega-categories those diagrammatic sets whose every composable diagram is connected by an equivalence to a single cell. We then define a semistrict model providing algebraic composites and study the embedding of strict omega-categories into this model. Finally, we prove a version of the homotopy hypothesis for the infinity-groupoids in the weak model, and exhibit a specific mistake in a proof by Kapranov and Voevodsky that had previously been refuted indirectly.},

	abstract = {Hofmann and Streicher famously showed how to lift Grothendieck universes into presheaf topoi, and Streicher has extended their result to the case of sheaf topoi by sheafification. In parallel, van den Berg and Moerdijk have shown in the context of algebraic set theory that similar constructions continue to apply even in weaker metatheories. Unfortunately, sheafification seems not to preserve an important realignment property enjoyed by the presheaf universes that plays a critical role in models of univalent type theory as well as synthetic Tait computability, a recent technique to establish syntactic properties of type theories and programming languages. In the context of multiple universes, the realignment property also implies a coherent choice of codes for connectives at each universe level, thereby interpreting the cumulativity laws present in popular formulations of Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of type theory. We observe that a slight adjustment to an argument of Shulman constructs a cumulative universe hierarchy satisfying the realignment property at every level in any Grothendieck topos. Hence one has direct-style interpretations of Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of type theory with cumulative universes into all Grothendieck topoi. A further implication is to extend the reach of recent synthetic methods in the semantics of cubical type theory and the syntactic metatheory of type theory and programming languages to all Grothendieck topoi.},

	abstract = {This is an introductory textbook to univalent mathematics and homotopy type theory, a mathematical foundation that takes advantage of the structural nature of mathematical definitions and constructions. It is common in mathematical practice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to identify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this common practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups in set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other hand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that accommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what it means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to Martin-L{\textbackslash}"of's dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent mathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point of view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic reasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior familiarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.},

The reader is first introduced to category theory, starting with basic definitions and concepts before progressing to more advanced themes. Concrete examples and exercises illustrate the topics, ranging from colimits to constructions such as the Day convolution product. Part II covers important applications of category theory, giving a thorough introduction to simplicial objects including an account of quasi-categories and Segal sets. Diagram categories play a central role throughout the book, giving rise to models of iterated loop spaces, and feature prominently in functor homology and homology of small categories},

Its general aim can be stated as 'modelling non-reversible phenomena' and its domain should be distinguished from that of classical algebraic topology by the principle that directed spaces have privileged directions and directed paths therein need not be reversible. Its homotopical tools (corresponding in the classical case to ordinary homotopies, fundamental group and fundamental groupoid) should be similarly 'non-reversible': directed homotopies, fundamental monoid and fundamental category. Homotopy constructions occur here in a directed version, which gives rise to new 'shapes', like directed cones and directed spheres. Applications will deal with domains where privileged directions appear, including rewrite systems, traffic networks and biological systems. The most developed examples can be found in the area of concurrency.},

theoretical computer science. The first is automata theory, whose objects of study are models
of computation with limited memory. The second is the theory of programming languages,
in particular of the λ-calculus upon which the functional paradigm is based.
It is known that the functions from strings to booleans definable by programs written
in the simply typed λ-calculus, using Church encodings, correspond exactly to regular
languages. Taking this as our starting point, we give several other characterizations of
automata-theoretic classes of languages and string-to-string (or even tree-to-tree) functions
using λ-calculi with linear types. To prove those results, we develop some connections
between denotational semantics – which we use to evaluate λ-terms – and categorical
automata theory; in particular, we show that monoidal closed categories, which appear in the
semantics of linear logic, also provide a basis to generalize some constructions on automata
that morally involve function spaces. Our investigations into linear λ-calculi also lead us to
introduce and study a new transducer model that computes string-to-string functions with
polynomial growth},
